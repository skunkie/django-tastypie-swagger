## Django Tastypie Swagger

**django-tastypie-swagger** is a small adapter library to construct [Swagger](http://swagger.wordnik.com/) documentation from [Tastypie](https://django-tastypie.readthedocs.org) resources.

This package provides two things:

1. An embedded instance of [Swagger UI](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui) to point a URL to.
2. Automatic [Resource Listing](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/wiki/Resource-Listing) and [API Declaration](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/wiki/API-Declaration) generation that is consumed by #1

## Documentation

Detailed documentation is available on [Read The Docs](http://django-tastypie-swagger.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).


## Installation

Install package::

    pip install django-tastypie-swagger

Add to INSTALLED_APPS::

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...

        'tastypie_swagger',

        ...
    ]


## Getting Started

Enable documentation for an api endpoint by adding a URL to your urlpatterns.

eg::

  
    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        ...

        url(r'api/myapi/doc/',
          include('tastypie_swagger.urls', namespace='myapi_tastypie_swagger'),
          kwargs={"tastypie_api_module":"myapp.registration.my_api", "namespace":"myapi_tastypie_swagger"}
        ),

        ...
    )


To declare more than one endpoint, repeat the above URL definition and change the namespace.

Swagger documentation will be served up at the URL(s) you configured.

### Swagger V1 v.s. V2

The following URI are according to Swagger Spec 1.2:

	* `/resources/`
	* `/schema/`
	* `/schema/<resource_name>`
	
The Swagger Spec V2.0 compliant `swagger.json` is served at the following URLs.
Both URLs return the same content. 

	* `/specs/` 
	* `/specs/swagger.json`  

Note that the V2 specs are generated by mapping the V1 output to V2. This 
ensures that existing Tastypie Apis continue to work unmodified. 

### Testing

The `example` folder contains a Django app to test tastypie-swagger. Run tests
as follows:

```python
$ cd /path/to/tastypie_swagger
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ cd example
$ manage.py test
```
